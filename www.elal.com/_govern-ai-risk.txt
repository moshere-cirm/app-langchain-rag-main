FAQs



















What is responsible AI?






Responsible AI is the practice of creating and deploying AI with the positive intention of doing good for employees, customers, and the world as a whole. Use of AI should be legal, ethical, and safe. This is particularly important as new generative AI technology and algorithms become available.
 
As the Biden-Harris Administration noted, it’s not just about law – “when it comes to AI, we must place people and communities at the center by supporting responsible innovation that serves the public good, while protecting our society, security, and economy. Importantly, this means that companies have a fundamental responsibility to make sure their products are safe before they are deployed or made public.”
 
Learn more about how to embrace responsible AI.









How can we ensure that AI systems are safe and secure?






Responsible, secure, AI adoption requires a comprehensive AI strategy, with complete buy-in from stakeholders, that integrates privacy considerations, fostering a privacy-focused culture around AI decision-making, and mitigating the risks of AI.  
 
Hear from Linda Thielova, OneTrust's DPO, to learn more about how privacy professionals can lead initiatives to navigate responsible AI adoption. 









Should AI be regulated?






Designed to be broad and industry-agnostic, the EU AI Act  is the first comprehensive regulation of its kind. 
 
While global lawmakers are taking steps to extend existing privacy laws to encompass AI, prominent regulatory bodies have provided valuable guidelines for effective AI governance. Tech giants like Google are proactively recognizing the benefits of adhering to AI regulations, acknowledging its profound impact on businesses. Regulating AI goes beyond ethical and legal considerations – it’s a pivotal business strategy for risk management, building trust, and gaining a competitive edge.
