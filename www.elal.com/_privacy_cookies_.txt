COOKIE TABLE
This Cookie Table provides you with information about the cookies and other similar technologies Outbrain and/or its partners may use, their purpose and the retention period associated with such cookie. Where a third party partner drops a cookie, they determine the purpose for which that cookie is dropped and the relevant retention period.
We may place cookies or similar files such as pixel tags and web beacons on the devices you use to engage with Outbrain for security purposes, to facilitate site navigation and to personalize your experience when you engage with Outbrain as a Site Vistior, a User or a Business Partner. Cookies allow us to collect technical and navigational information, such as browser type, time spent by you engaging with Outbrain and pages visited. Please read our Privacy Policy to further understand how we use data collected by these cookies and see below for a description of the different categories:
User: you are a User when you visit a website or application of one of Outbrain’s partners (website or application publisher) where the Outbrain widget is implemented. For example, if you visit https://news.sky.com/uk or www.cnn.com, the Outbrain widget is implemented on those websites. You know you are engaging with our widget when it is labelled with a text referencing Outbrain (e.g., “Smartfeed” or “Recommended by Outbrain”, with the Outbrain logo near recommendations and advertisements). If you click on the hyperlinked reference to Outbrain you will see a detailed information notice that enables you to navigate to Outbrain’s Interest Profile, which provides information on the interest categories we think you might be interested in, which websites you have visited where Outbrain technology is installed and which device and browser is used, and the ability to opt out (or Do Not Sell) or withdraw your consent from interest based advertisements.
Site Visitor: you are a Site Visitor when you visit and interact with any of our websites, namely Outbrain.com (or any derivation, such as Outbrain.co.uk; Outbrain.fr; Outbrain.de etc.). You may review your cookies settings at any time by clicking this button: Cookies Settings
Business Partners: you are a Business Partner when you register (or email with Outbrain) on behalf of the company you work for to use the Outbrain Amplify or Outbrain Engage services.
For even more information about cookies, we recommend visiting this website.
