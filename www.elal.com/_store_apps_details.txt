The login user journey is completely useless. To login with email verification I have to switch apps, which, upon return to this app completely restarts the process without maintaining state. Other login options give me an error message which is a code number without text. Great. When opening my email from the computer I manage to login, and then the option to remain signed in seems to have no effect... In short, don't rely on this app for anything, especially not abroad.14 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoA Google usermore_vert Flag inappropriateSeptember 26, 2019Unacceptable that the app forces me to upgrade, while roaming, before allowing access to the boarding pass. Also, very annoying the delay when it starts, adding also several ads. Let use the app, for the purpose intended, and when needed. Want to promote, the are friendlier ways to do. Start with attractive promotions.37 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoEL AL Israel Airlines Ltd.October 2, 2019Hi, we are always looking to improve the experience for our users, and really appreciate the feedback.

Have to log in each time you use the app. Security is so good that it is almost unusable. I would hope that a one time login would be a good fix.1 person found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSee all reviewsWhat's newEmbark on a seamless journey with the EL AL app, now featuring the innovative 'Flight Feed' – your personal travel assistant:-Countdown to Takeoff - Watch as your flight time approaches, with dynamic updates.-Seat Selection at a Glance - Choose your comfort zone effortlessly.-Check-In and Boarding Pass - Easy access, with timely notifications.-Be prepared with an updated weather forecast and a currency calculator.-Document Management - Keep your travel documents organized and accessible.flagFlag as inappropriateApp supportexpand_morepublicWebsiteemailSupport emailAppelal@elal.co.ilshieldPrivacy PolicySimilar appsarrow_forwardNorwegian Travel AssistantNorwegian Air Shuttle ASA4.6starSchiphol Amsterdam AirportSchiphol Airport3.5starOrbitz Hotels & Flightsorbitz.com4.3starAustrian AirlinesAustrian Airlines4.5starCheapOair: Cheap Flight DealsFareportal Inc.4.4starCheap Flights Ferries Hotelscapetowncheapflights.com4.4starflagFlag as inappropriateGoogle PlayPlay PassPlay PointsGift cardsRedeemRefund policyKids & familyParent GuideFamily sharingTerms of ServicePrivacyAbout Google PlayDevelopersGoogle StoreAll prices include VAT.Israel (English (United States))
