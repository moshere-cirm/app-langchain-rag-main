Firefox for Android provides a basic level of control over privacy-related data. You can easily clear ALL private data, but unlike the desktop version of firefox you cannot delete cookies for an individual website.
The following tutorial demonstrates how to clear all private and historical data from your browser.





To clear private data, cookies, history and settings in Firefox for Android, tap the Main menu > More > Settings.
Select Clear private data from the Privacy & Security section of the Settings screen.
Choose the data you want to keep or clear by enabling the check boxes.
Tap Clear data.

A notification appears confirming your data was cleared.

To clear private data, cookies, history and settings in Firefox for Android, tap the Menu button (either  at the bottom right on some devices or in the upper right of the browser)
, then tap Settings (on some devices you may have to tap More first).
Tap Privacy and then tap Clear private data.
Choose the data you want to keep or clear by enabling the check boxes.
Tap Clear data.

A notification appears confirming your data was cleared.
