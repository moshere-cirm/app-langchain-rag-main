Audit your website 





Identify and maintain an evergreen inventory of all first- and third-party cookies and tracking technologies across your website. Use advanced scanning to simulate the user experience, scan behind logins, and trigger hidden pages.











Automatically categorize cookies and trackers 





Use the world’s largest database of over 45 million pre-categorized cookies to group trackers by purpose. Clarify and update cookie names at any time using intuitive descriptions, vendor information, and lifespans.











Easily configure the consent experience 





Professionally designed templates empower you to create a seamless user experience with custom branding, support for more than 250 languages, and geolocation rules to display different banners and consent models based on region, country, or state.











Enable cookie auto-blocking to ensure compliance 





Use no-code cookie blocking, tag manager integrations, or script re-writing to block trackers until explicit consent is gained. Enable support for industry frameworks and vendor-specific opt-outs.











Automate scanning and maintain records 





Schedule regular scans on your website and auto-populate your updated cookie list into your privacy or cookie policies. Demonstrate compliance with a detailed user consent transaction database.











Optimize your cookie consent banner to maximize opt-ins 





Experiment with A/B testing to deploy template variations, measure consent, and drive opt-ins. Define attributes and logic using template targeting and sync consent of known users across devices.











Extend your consent options 





Extend cookie consent to Mobile App Consent and OTT & CTV Consent, managing all user consent and preferences through the OneTrust platform.
