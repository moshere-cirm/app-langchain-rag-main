Description



Topup your Rav-Kav transit card with you phone!

Tap the Rav-Kav card near the camera area on your device (back or front), check your balance, select the contract you want, pay using all major credit cards, debit cards or Apple Pay. Don't forget to tap your Rav-Kav again to complete the topup and you're ready for your next journey!

You can choose between Credit value which is acceptable by all public transit operators in Israel, or a Daily, Weekly and Monthly passes according to the area of your travel.

Contracts sold on this app are valid for your rides on Trains in Israel and in the following bus service operators: Dan, Egged, Metropoline, Kavim, Superbus, Afikim and more

We also like to emphasize that writing on Rav-Kav is a very delicate process, and displacement of Rav-Kav or smartphone cover which is too thick can interfere with the success of charging the Rav-Kav.

    Easiest way to charge my ride



This app is so easy- my kids taught me how to use it and the panic of the uncharged card is gone!

    Beyond unreliable



You’re on a bus, you swipe your card as normal, and you realize your card needs a recharge as the doors are shutting. You go to refill, but ERROR! The app isn’t working.

You now have only two options. 1. Miss your ride. 2. Get fined if you didn’t realize in time.

I really want to like this app. But the number of times it just stops working out of nowhere has actually caused pretty significant issues on numerous occasions. I personally recommend using a different one.

Hi, we recommend not to top-up the card at the last minute, also you can download the RavPass application and pay with QR code scans instead
