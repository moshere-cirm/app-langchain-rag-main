Dangerous Goods Guidance for Passengers

















Need Help?


Contact us



Dangerous goods can only be transported by air if they are prepared by qualified personnel, unless if they are excepted. However, some dangerous goods may be carried in baggage by passengers and crew if the specified requirements can be met.

Items that can be carried in checked or carry-on baggage
See which dangerous goods can be transported in an aircraft in this extract of the Dangerous Goods Regulations which sets the standards for the transport of dangerous goods by air.

English (pdf), French (pdf), German (pdf), Russian (pdf), and, Spanish (pdf)

Lithium batteries
A lithium battery can be carried by air depending on its configuration and Watt-hour rating (for rechargeable) or lithium content (for non-rechargeable). In addition, spare batteries may not be placed in checked baggage.
Find more information about transporting lithium batteries (pdf)
Small lithium battery powered vehicles notice
Balance wheel, air wheel, solo wheel, mini balance board and hoverboard, are considered small lithium battery powered vehicles. Please find instructions and a list of airlines that don't accept these devices in passenger baggage: see the small vehicles powered by lithium batteries - passenger provisions (pdf).
Carriage of battery-powered mobility aids
To support operators (airlines) to safely and efficiently accept and transport battery-powered wheelchairs and mobility aids required by passengers with reduced mobility. IATA with our member airlines prepared the battery-powered wheelchair and mobility aid guidance document (pdf).
Download the guidance document to see the requirements that apply to battery-powered mobility aids in accordance with the 64th (2023) edition of the IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations. The guidance document includes information that passengers should provide to the airline to ensure that on arrival at the airport, their battery-powered mobility aid can be accepted and loaded on the aircraft with the minimum of delay.
Frequently asked questions
 I am really unsure which of my personal belongings may be allowed and which not. I have doubts about my aftershave/hairspray/gas cartridge for a curling iron, etc.
Most usual toiletry items in reasonable quantities are acceptable and therefore allowed in carry-on and checked baggage.  See the link to Table 2.3.A at the top of the page for more details.
 
However, be aware that security requirements restrict liquids in carry-on baggage to those in containers of no more than 100 milliliters (3 fluid ounce). In addition, the liquids must be packed in a clear sealed bag.
 
For special items please check with your airline when making your reservation.
 
I am planning to travel and want to take a number of items powered by lithium batteries, such as a mobile (cell) phone, tablet, laptop, drone or GPS.  Is that a problem?
Provided the batteries are either installed in the equipment or packed in a way that they are sufficiently protected against short circuits there should not be a problem. The carriage of electronic devices powered by larger lithium batteries, such as power tools are subject to the airline’s approval.
 
However, please be prepared for extended security checks when traveling with an unusual amount of electronic equipment. Also, be aware that, although you may be allowed to carry these items, their use on board the aircraft may be prohibited or at least limited. Check with your airline for further details.
 
 I am a sailor/pilot/skier and I want to travel by air with my life vest/parachute/avalanche rescue backpack. Are there any exceptions?
Passengers may carry certain articles even though the article contains dangerous goods. Parachutes themselves are not restricted. Some parachutes are fitted with an automatic activation device (AAD), e.g Cypres, which contain small quantities of explosive material. Most of these are not classified as dangerous goods and are not restricted in passenger baggage.
 
A single (1) avalanche rescue backpack per person is authorized containing a cylinder of compressed gas in Division 2.2. They may also contain an explosive trigger mechanism containing less than 200 mg net of explosives in Division 1.4S.
 
Self-inflating life jackets are permitted if they contain not more than two small cylinders with a non-flammable gas in Division 2.2 plus not more than two spare cartridges per person.
 
For items that are acceptable only with approval from the airline, consult with your airline well in advance and also allow additional time for check-in.
 
 For my personal safety I always carry a small can of aerosol self-defense spray (such as mace, pepper spray, etc). Is there any problem?
Yes, disabling devices of any kind are forbidden in both carry-on and check-in baggage.
 
 I am a sporting shooter and need to travel to a competition with my weapon and ammunition. Is there anything I have to observe?
Sporting weapons and an amount of ammunition up to 5 kg (11 lb) may be in passenger checked baggage only. The weapon must be unloaded and be in its designated transport box. Please check with the airline you intend to travel with to make necessary arrangements.
 
 I have a disability and want to travel with my battery-powered wheelchair. Can I travel by air with that?
Yes, but there are different procedures depending on the type of the batteries your wheelchair uses. Most modern types use gel-type non-spillable batteries, which are considered to be non-dangerous and can be loaded along with the checked baggage in the cargo compartment of an aircraft.
 
Older “wet cell” batteries will require disconnection of the battery and possibly removal of the battery from the wheelchair with the battery being packed in a special box, depending on the type of aircraft.
 
Lithium battery powered wheelchairs will also have additional requirements, please check with the manufacturer/distributor of your wheelchair and battery to get appropriate documentation.
 
Passengers traveling with a mobility aid should make advance arrangements with the airline and provide information on the type of battery installed and on the handling of the mobility aid (including instructions on how to isolate the battery).  For more details about battery-powered wheelchairs, please refer to the Battery-Powered Wheelchair and Mobility Aid Guidance Document above.
 
 I have to transport urgent patient specimens but they have to be kept refrigerated. What do I need to do when I want to carry such specimen as a passenger?
Only specimens that have a minimal likelihood of containing pathogens may be carried in passenger baggage. If there is any doubt then the specimens must be treated as infectious substances, Category B, packaged according to Packing Instruction 650 and consigned as cargo. Infectious substances may be packed with Dry Ice (Carbon Dioxide, solid) or in a so-called Dry Shipper if they need to be kept refrigerated.
 

More information on infectious substances classification and packaging can be found in the DG Documentation page.
