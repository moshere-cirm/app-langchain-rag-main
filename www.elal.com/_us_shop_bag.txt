If you completed the steps to authorize activation with AT&T, T-Mobile, or Verizon when you purchased your new iPhone online, it will arrive ready to use. Just turn it on and follow the onscreen instructions to set it up and activate with the carrier. To activate with eSIM, you will need Wi-Fi for setup.
If you choose "Connect to a carrier later" when you buy your iPhone, you can activate with your service when you receive your device. If you're asked to transfer your SIM, follow the onscreen instructions to transfer service from your previous iPhone.
