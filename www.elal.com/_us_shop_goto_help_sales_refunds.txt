Apple Store Purchase Policies











U.S. Sales and Refund Policy
Thanks for shopping at Apple. We want you to have a rewarding experience while you’re exploring, evaluating, and purchasing our products, whether you’re in an Apple Store location, on Apple Store Online, using the Apple Store App, or calling Retail Customer Care (“Apple Store”).
By placing an order or making a purchase at an Apple Store, you agree to the terms below, along with Apple’s Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.
Standard Return Policy
We believe you will be thrilled with the products you purchase from the Apple Store. In the unlikely event a product is not what you expected, you can return or exchange it with a receipt within 14 days of the date you receive the product from Apple. The product must be in its original condition with all of its included parts, accessories, and packaging and we’ll exchange it or offer a refund based on the payment method. In addition, please note:

Apple products purchased through other retailers must be returned to those retailers in accordance with their returns and refunds policies.
Products can be returned only in the country where purchased.
For returns for cash or cash equivalent over $750, Apple will mail a refund check to you within 10 business days.
For returns with a gift receipt, Apple will offer you an Apple Gift Card.
For returns paid with your Apple Account balance, Apple will refund the portion paid to your Apple Account or, if unable, an Apple Gift Card.
Returned products may require inspection. If approved, a refund or exchange will be issued within 10 business days.
Apple provides security features to protect your product in case of loss or theft. If these features were activated and cannot be disabled by the person in possession, Apple may refuse the return or exchange.
To return ten or more of the same product, you must return to the Apple Store where purchased.
For complete details on how to return a product purchased at the Apple Store please visit the Returns & Refunds page.

Return of AppleCare+ under an iPhone Upgrade Program
Should you return the AppleCare+ portion of your iPhone Upgrade Program, you will lose your Upgrade Option as set forth in iPhone Upgrade Program Terms & Conditions.
Returns of Products with Wireless Services – Service Cancellation
Wireless carriers have different service cancellation policies. Returning Apple products with wireless services may not automatically cancel or reset your wireless account. You are responsible for your wireless service agreement and any fees associated with your wireless account. Please contact your wireless service provider for more information.
ZEISS Optical Inserts
ZEISS Optical Inserts - Prescription are custom, third-party products and may not be returned to an Apple Store location. Apple will accept returns on behalf of ZEISS within 14 days of the date you receive them. To return, sign in to your Order Listing page or call 1-800-MY-APPLE. 
ZEISS Optical Inserts - Readers can be returned to an Apple Store location. Apple will accept returns within 14 days of the date you receive them. To return, go to an Apple Store location, sign in to your Order Listing page, or call 1-800-MY-APPLE.
Additional Apple Product Terms
The purchase and/or use of Apple products are subject to additional terms and conditions found at https://www.apple.com/legal/sla and https://www.apple.com/legal/warranty.
Making unauthorized modifications to the software on an iPhone violates the iPhone software license agreement and is jail-breaking. If you are unable to use your iPhone due to an unauthorized software modification, its repair will not be covered under the warranty.
Pricing and Price Reductions/Corrections
Apple reserves the right to change prices for products at the Apple Store at any time, and to correct inadvertent pricing errors. Additional information about pricing and sales tax is available on the Payment & Pricing page. If you were charged more than the posted price in an Apple Store location, see a Manager about a refund of the overcharge.
Should Apple reduce the price on any Apple-branded product within 14 calendar days from the date you receive your product, visit an Apple Store location or contact Retail Customer Care at 1-800-MY-APPLE within 14 days of the price change to request a refund or credit of the difference in price. This excludes limited-time price reductions and special sales events, such as Black Friday. Price protection is limited to 10 units of a particular product and we may require that you have the product with you and/or have proof of possession to use it.
Prices shown are in U.S. dollars. If you pay for your order with an international card, the price may fluctuate with exchange rates and/or your card issuer may charge foreign conversion charges and fees.
Order Acceptance/Confirmation
Apple may refuse or cancel any order or limit order quantity. Apple may also require additional qualifying information prior to processing any order. Once we receive your online or phone order, we’ll provide you with an email order confirmation. Your receipt of an order confirmation does not signify acceptance of your order or constitute confirmation of our offer to sell; we are simply confirming that we received your order. The Apple Store reserves the right to accept or decline your order at any time for any reason. If Apple cancels an order after payment, Apple will refund it.
Shipping & Delivery
Please review the Shipping & Pickup page to learn about how and when you will receive the products you purchased from the Apple Store. Since delivery of your order can be impacted by events beyond Apple’s control once it leaves our facilities, Apple cannot be held liable for late deliveries. We will, however, work with you to ensure a smooth delivery. 
As Apple takes care of the dispatch of the products you purchase on the Apple Store, the risk of loss of, or damage to, products shall pass to you when you, or a person designated by you, acquires physical possession of the products. Title in the products shall pass to you when the products are picked up by the carrier from our warehouse. At this point, you will receive the Shipment Notification Email. If there are any issues with delivery, please contact Apple to resolve. 
In-Store Pickup and Return
Apple offers in-store pickup for many of its products. Certain products and payment methods, however, may not qualify for in-store pickup. Only you or the person designated by you may pick up the item(s) purchased. A government-issued photo ID and order number will be required for pickup. Apple will notify you when your order is ready and the date by which you need to pick up your items. We’ll also send you a reminder or two, in case it slips your mind. If you don’t pick up your order, Apple may cancel it. Please visit http://apple.com/us/shop/help/shipping_delivery for more details.
Pickup Contact
If you select in-store pickup, you may be able to designate a third party to pick up your order. You must provide their name and email address. Certain products and payment methods are not eligible for in-store pickup by a third party. The third party will need to bring a government issued photo ID and order number for pickup. Apple is not responsible for actions taken by the third party once your item(s) have been picked up.
Consumers Only
The Apple Store sells and ships products to end-user customers only, and we reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order if we suspect you are purchasing products for resale.
U.S. Sales and Shipping Only
The Apple Store accepts orders from billing addresses within the U.S. and most U.S. territories. Products purchased online from the U.S. will only be shipped to addresses within the U.S. and are subject to U.S. and foreign export control laws and regulations. Products must be purchased, sold, exported, re-exported, transferred, and used in compliance with these laws and regulations. To purchase Apple products online from outside of the U.S., please visit https://www.apple.com/choose-country-region for international Apple Store information.
Product Availability and Limitations
Given the popularity and supply constraints of some products, Apple may have to limit the number available for purchase and reserves the right to change the number at any time, even after you place an order. In the event we cannot supply a product you ordered, Apple will cancel the order and refund your purchase price.
Gift Cards
Apple Gift Cards cannot be returned. For Apple Gift Card Terms and Conditions, please visit https://www.apple.com/legal/giftcards/applestore.
iPhone Installments
For iPhone Installments Terms and Conditions, please visit https://www.apple.com/legal/sales-support/iphoneinstallments_us.
